\section{Theory}
To evaluate the performance of our classification model, we consider the accuracy score, given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:accuracy}
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nI(t_i=y_i)}{n},
\end{equation}
where $t_i$ is the target, $y_i$ is our model output and $I$ is the indicator function, 
\[
I = \begin{cases} 
1 & t_i = y_i\\
0 & t_i \neq y_i
\end{cases} .
\]

\section{Data}
In this paper we are using credit card payment data from a Taiwanese bank downloaded from the \href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients}{UCI Machine Learning Repository}. The response variable is a binary variable of default payment with Yes = 1, No = 0.  The data set consists of 30 000 observations, with X amount of observations with default payments. There are 23 explanatory variables, which the original paper describes as:
\begin{itemize}
\item X1: Amount of the given credit (NT dollar): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit.
\item X2: Gender (1 = male; 2 = female).
\item X3: Education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others).
\item X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others).
\item X5: Age (year).
\item X6 - X11: History of past payment. We tracked the past monthly payment records (from April to September, 2005) as follows: X6 = the repayment status in September, 2005; X7 = the repayment status in August, 2005; . . .;X11 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above.
\item X12-X17: Amount of bill statement (NT dollar). X12 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; X13 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; . . .; X17 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005.
\item X18-X23: Amount of previous payment (NT dollar). X18 = amount paid in September, 2005; X19 = amount paid in August, 2005; . . .;X23 = amount paid in April, 2005.
\end{itemize}
