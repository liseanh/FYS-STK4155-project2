List of things to get done:
 - Randomized grid search to find optimal parameters for LR (batch_size=200, find n_epochs and learning_rate)
 - Cumulative gains curve for LR 
 - Make regression plot 
 - Beautify figures (dimensions, titles etc.)
 - Somehow find optimal parameters for MLP
 - Write report 
 - generate Franke data for sigma=1 and with sigma=0.1 with x_points=y_points=20 for both
 - IF regression of Franke with sigma=0.1, x_points=y_points=20 turns out horrible, try  with x_points=y_points=100 instead
