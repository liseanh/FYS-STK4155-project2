List of things to get done:
 - Randomized grid search to find optimal parameters for LR (batch_size=200, find n_epochs and learning_rate)
 - Cumulative gains curve for LR 
 - Make regression plot 
 - Beautify figures (dimensions, titles etc.)
 - Somehow find optimal parameters for MLP
 - Write report
